Installing package dependencies
===============================

To use bemovi several programs need to be installed beforehand:

-   [ImageJ](http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) and the [LOCI Bio-formats plug-in](http://loci.wisc.edu/software/bio-formats)

-   ParticleLinker, which is a standalone version of the
    ParticleTracker 3D plug-in developed by the [MOSAIC group](http://mosaic.mpi-cbg.de/). 
    This ParticleLinker is provided with
    the bemovi package and should be placed in a directory on the
    computer, where the user has administrator rights. (You may also get
    this application from the dropbox link given above, in the folder
    “Software”, file “ParticleLinker.jar”)

-   [R - The statistical computing environment](http://www.r-project.org/)

-   the bemovi package itself, which can either be installed from github
    or via the source package

Note that it is probably best to only use the 64-bit version of ImageJ
(and that you can ensure this by deleting the 32-bit version). You may
also like to use Fiji, but please note that bemovi does not use Fiji.
