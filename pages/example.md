The example works on some demonstration videos that are available at:
<https://www.dropbox.com/sh/i9u2opuc1l8y764/AADy-AWdNfMbu5DLsLhKaP0ja>
(In the folder “1 - raw” are videos for use in this worked example. In
the folder “Software” is the ParticleLinker mentioned below.) Each of
the videos is a five second video taken at 25 frames per second, of
monocultures or mixed cultures of three species of ciliate.

Please note we use the terms “directory” and “folder” interchangeably
below.
