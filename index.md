Bemovi is an R package that allows to extract abundance, behaviour and morphology of individual 
organisms from video sequences. The package relies on R - the statistical computing environment
and ImageJ, as well as the ParticleTracker plug-in developed for ImageJ.

Start by reading the [Installation page](pages/installation.html), which
explains how to install the bemovi package as well as its dependencies. Then read the
[worked example](pages/example.html).
