Bemovi is an R package that allows to extract abundance, behaviour and morphology of individual 
organisms from video sequences. The package relies on R - the statistical computing environment
and ImageJ, as well as the ParticleTracker plug-in developed for ImageJ.

This web site provides information how to use bemovi, from
installing the necessary software, to conducting analyses. 

Start by reading the [installation page](pages/installation.html), which
explains how to install the bemovi package as well as its dependencies. Then download the
example videos and  go through the [analysis](pages/analysis.html) and [processing demonstration](pages/processing.html).
