Title: BEMOVI, software for extracting BEhaviour and MOrphology from VIdeos. This version is adapted for LEEF-UZH
Description: An R and ImageJ based work flow to automatically measure behaviour
    and morphology from videos. Moving individuals are identified by background
    subtraction, morphology extracted, and trajectories assembled through time from
    coordinate data. Abundance, morphology and behaviour can be summarized based on
    trajectory data.
